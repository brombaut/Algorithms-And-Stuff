### Questions

1. **What are the drawbacks to using Wi-Fi connectivity?**
* Wi-Fi can be difficult for end user setup. It's also not available everywhere.

2. **What are the drawbacks to using Ethernet connectivity?**
* Many devices aren't used in areas where wiring has been run.

3. **What are the drawbacks to using cellular connectivity?**
* Cellular connectivity is expensive. It can also have increased latency and larger power requirements when compared to other methods.

4. **What are some advantages to using a single-board computer with embedded Linux? What are the drawbacks?**
* Having access to a full operating system, such as Linux, can simplify software development. However, *Single-Board Computers (SBCs)* are relatively expensive and offer few board-level connectivity options and peripherals when compared to microcontrollers. They also require lots of power, relatively speaking.

5. **What are some advantages to using a microcontroller in your IoT device?**
* Many IoT devices will need to use a microcontroller to provide their basic functionality anyway. Microcontrollers are chpea, offer a wide range of peripherals, are able to meet real-time performance constraints, and can run on very little power.

6. **Is the use of HTTPS always appropriate in IoT device communication?**
* HTTPS is a decent way to secure IoT communication for most applications; however, it has a lot of processing and bandwidth overhead. Each application is unique, and the security scheme used should be chosen based on your exact needs.
