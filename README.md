A collection of resources and examples of topics I've read that I'd like to have easy access to.

### Project Ideas for Later
- [ ] Write a floating point package (WASM, TDD)
- [ ] Implement different encryption algorithms
- [ ] Some sort of a networking project to get a better understanding of networking protocols
